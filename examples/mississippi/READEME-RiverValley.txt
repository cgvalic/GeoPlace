RiverValley

Here are a series of toy images of the Mississippi river valley system, with varying resolutions and features. 

river-roi.xcf is a gimp image file, suitable for future editing.
rivervalley.bmp is an overview picture for human consumption.
The other pictues are designed for machine consumption, for subfootprint placement. Darker is meant to indicate higher-priority. 

Files are bitmaps, 16 bits: 5r 6g 5b

The resolutions vary by factors of 2x2 from 640x480 down to 5 x 4
The file suffix is the first resolution number, the number of horizontal pixels, the number of columns. Each file was made by scaling the next-larger file, not the first largest file.

The 4 features are:
cities, darkest
river junctions, darkest
skinny rivers, dark
fattened area around rivers, light

The map in rivervalley.bmp came from wikipedia.
The other figures were tracings of that, done by Scott Mitchell, using Gimp.
